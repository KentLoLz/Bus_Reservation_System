# Bus_Reservation_System

This project can make the ticket booking procedure to be simplified to a level that only the user needs to be involved in the process. This not only saves time for the user who doesnâ€™t have to visit the station physically, but also saves the cost for the company from hiring the receptionist to sell the tickets.
